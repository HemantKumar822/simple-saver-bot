## Deploy on a VM in a Docker container

- First, add your bot to the **logging channel** and **subscription channel**. Both are required.
- Star and fork this repository. Then rename the file **_config.py** to **config.py**.
- Add your configuration to the **config.py** file.

### Setup Debian for Docker

[Install Docker Engine
](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
---

#### Setting up `config.py` (example for Ubuntu/Debian)

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/upekshaip/tg-ytdlp-bot.git
cd tg-ytdlp-bot
sudo mv _config.py config.py
nano config.py
```

Edit your configuration before deployment. After your edits, proceed with the Docker build steps below.

---

#### Get YouTube cookies

YouTube rotates account cookies frequently on open YouTube browser tabs as a security measure. To export cookies that will remain working with yt-dlp, you will need to export cookies in such a way that they are never rotated.

One way to do this is through a private browsing/incognito window:

- Open a new private browsing/incognito window and log into YouTube
- Open a new tab and close the YouTube tab
- Export youtube.com cookies from the browser then close the private browsing/incognito window so the session is never opened in the browser again.

For export you can use browser extension [Cookie-Editor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm)

create in project folder subfolder `cookies` and place `cookie.txt` extracted from YouTube here

```sh
cd tg-ytdlp-bot
mkdir cookies
nano cookie.txt
```
---

#### Building and Running with Docker

```sh
sudo docker build . -t tg-public-bot
sudo docker ps -a
sudo docker run tg-public-bot
```

(optional) If you want to use `/cookies_from_browser` command, after docker deployment you need to enter your docker CMD and install desktop environment (GUI) and Browser into your docker container.
Also you will need download `yt-dlp` binary into your Docker container. See [(Optional) Preparing `yt-dlp` for `/cookies_from_browser`](#optional-preparing-yt-dlp-for-cookies_from_browser)

---

## Alternative local deployment on a VM (without Docker container)

If you prefer local deployment rather than docker container, you should use this commands:

#### Install `git` and `python3` (example for Ubuntu/Debian)
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git python3.10 python3-pip python3.10-venv
```
#### Setting up `config.py`
```sh
git clone https://github.com/upekshaip/tg-ytdlp-bot.git
cd tg-ytdlp-bot
sudo mv _config.py config.py
nano config.py
```
Edit your configuration before deployment.

#### Install `python` modules

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
pip uninstall urllib3 -y
pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall "urllib3==1.26.20"
pip install --no-deps moviepy==1.0.3
python3 magic.py
```

### (Optional) Installing ffmpeg (example for Ubuntu/Debian)
<details>
  <summary>spoiler</summary> 
      
   If you prefer local deployment rather that docker container you also need to install `ffmpeg`
   **ffmpeg** is essential since **yt-dlp** relies on it for merging streams (and in some cases for transcoding or extracting thumbnails). To install ffmpeg on a Debian-based system, run:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg
   ```

   Verify the installation:
   ```sh
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

   If you need to support extra languages such as arabic, chinese, japanese, korean - you also need to install this language packs:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo add-apt-repository universe
   sudo apt update

   sudo apt install fonts-noto-core             # ‚Äì Noto Sans, Noto Serif, ‚Ä¶ base fonts Google Noto
   sudo apt install fonts-noto-extra            # ‚Äì extra fonts (including arabic)
   sudo apt install fonts-kacst fonts-kacst-one # ‚Äì KACST arabic fonts
   sudo apt install fonts-noto-cjk              # ‚Äì Chinese-Japanese-Korean characters
   ```

   For Amiri arabic:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aliftype/amiri.git
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/fonts/truetype/amiri
   sudo cp amiri/fonts/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/amiri/
   ```
   
   Update font cache
   ```sh
   sudo fc-cache -fv
   fc-list | grep -i amiri
   ```
</details>

### (Optional) Preparing `yt-dlp` for `/cookies_from_browser`
<details>
   <summary>spoiler</summary> 

   To use the `/cookies_from_browser` command (which extracts cookies from installed browsers on your server), ensure that the **yt-dlp** binary is set up properly:
  
   1. **Download `yt-dlp`**  
      Visit the [official `yt-dlp` releases page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) and download the binary for your CPU architecture (e.g., `yt-dlp_x86_64`, `yt-dlp_arm`, etc.).  
      Place the binary executable in the `tg-ytdlp-bot` project folder.
 
  2. **Rename and make it executable**  
     ```bash
     mv yt-dlp_linux yt-dlp
     chmod +x yt-dlp
     ```

   3. **Create a symbolic link**  
      Create a symlink so that `yt-dlp` can be run from any directory (for example, in `/usr/local/bin`):
      ```bash
      sudo ln -s /full/path/to/tg-ytdlp-bot/yt-dlp /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
      ```
      Ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH`. Now you can run `yt-dlp` directly.

   (Also in that case you must install desktop environment (GUI) and any supported by `yt-dlp` browser by yourself)

- Tags must start with `#` and contain only letters, digits, and underscore (`_`).
- Tags are automatically added to the caption of the video/audio, separated by spaces.
- All unique tags you send are saved in the `tags.txt` file in your user folder.

### Example of using tags:
```
https://youtu.be/STeeOaX2FBs?si=5rz1QhvuiauZ7A4d#youtube#mytag#tag123

---

### /tags Command

The `/tags` command lets you get a list of all your unique tags (one per line). If the list is long, the bot will send several messages.

**Example:**
```
/tags
```
Response:
```
#youtube
#mytag
#tag123
...
```
---

## Help

**This bot allows you to download videos and audio, and also work with playlists.**

‚Ä¢ Simply send a video link and the bot will start downloading. \
‚Ä¢ For playlists, specify the range of indexes separated by asterisks (e.g. `https://example.com*1*4`) to download videos from position 1 to 4. \
‚Ä¢ You can set a custom playlist name by adding it after the range (e.g. `https://example.com*1*4*My Playlist`). 

‚Ä¢ To change the caption of a video, reply to the video with your message ‚Äì the bot will send the video with your caption. \
‚Ä¢ To extract audio from a video, use the **/audio** command (e.g. `/audio https://example.com`). \
‚Ä¢ Upload a cookie file to download private videos and playlists. \
‚Ä¢ Check or update your cookie file with **/check_cookie**, **/download_cookie**, **/save_as_cookie** and **/cookies_from_browser** commands. \
‚Ä¢ To clean your workspace on server from bad files (e.g. old cookies or media) use **/clean** command (might be helpfull for get rid of errors). \
‚Ä¢ See your usage statistics and logs by sending the **/usage** command. \
‚Ä¢ Control subtitle embedding with **/subs** command - enable or disable automatic subtitle burning into videos. \

## Added New Features

- Per-user cookie download.
- Per-user database.
- Custom playlist naming.
- MP3 audio download support (/audio command).

---

## Auto-Cleaning User Directories with Crontab

To prevent your server from filling up with downloaded files, you can set up a crontab task that runs every 24 hours and deletes all files in user directories (except for `cookie.txt` and `logs.txt`).

For example, add the following line to your crontab:

```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/find /root/Telegram/tg-ytdlp-bot/users -type f ! -name "cookie.txt" ! -name "logs.txt" -delete
```

**Explanation:**
- `0 0 * * *` ‚Äì Executes the command every day at midnight.
- `/usr/bin/find /CHANGE/ME/TO/REAL/PATH/TO/tg-ytdlp-bot/users -type f` ‚Äì Searches for all files under the users directory.
- `! -name "cookie.txt" ! -name "logs.txt"` ‚Äì Excludes `cookie.txt` and `logs.txt` files from deletion.
- `-delete` ‚Äì Deletes the files found.

---

## TODO

- ~~Add a custom formatter selector for downloads.~~
- ~~Enhance MP3 support.~~
- Add Google Drive support to store files.

Below is an example section for your GitHub README.md that explains how to set up Firebase for your Telegram bot, including creating a Firebase project, setting up a Realtime Database with authentication, and creating a user.

---

## Firebase Setup for Telegram Bot

This section describes how to create a Firebase project, set up the Realtime Database with authentication, create a test user, and integrate Firebase into your Telegram bot.

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click **Add Project** (or select an existing project).
2. Follow the setup wizard to create your new project.
3. After the project is created, navigate to **Project Settings** and copy your configuration parameters (such as `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `databaseURL`, `projectId`, etc.). These values are required for configuring the connection in your bot.

### 2. Create a Realtime Database

1. In the Firebase Console, select **Realtime Database**.
2. Click **Create Database**.
3. Choose your database location and set the mode. For initial testing, you may choose **Test Mode** (keep in mind that test mode does not enforce authentication).
4. Once your database is created, update its security rules as described in Step 4.

### 3. Enable Authentication

1. In the left-hand menu of the Firebase Console, select **Authentication**.
2. Click **Get Started**.
3. Navigate to the **Sign-in Method** tab and enable the desired provider. For a basic setup, enable **Email/Password**:
   - Click on **Email/Password**.
   - Toggle the switch to **Enable**.
4. After enabling the sign-in method, create a test user manually in the **Users** tab, or implement user registration in your application.

### 4. Update Realtime Database Security Rules

To restrict access to your database only to authenticated users, update your security rules as follows:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    // Allow access only to authenticated user with certain email
    ".read":  "auth != null && auth.token.email === 'YOUREMAIL@gmail.com'",
    ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.email === 'YOUREMAIL@gmail.com'"
  }
}
```

These rules allow read and write operations only if the request contains a valid `idToken`‚Äîmeaning the user is authenticated.

### 5. Autostart service

To create auto-start service for this bot - copy text from this file https://github.com/chelaxian/tg-ytdlp-bot/blob/main/etc/systemd/system/tg-ytdlp-bot.service and paste it to 
```bash
/etc/systemd/system/tg-ytdlp-bot.service
```
do not forget to change path in service to yoyr actual path

reload systemctl and enable/start service
```bash
systemctl daemon-reexec
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable tg-ytdlp-bot.service
systemctl restart tg-ytdlp-bot.service
journalctl -u tg-ytdlp-bot -f
```
