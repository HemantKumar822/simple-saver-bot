#### Get YouTube cookies

YouTube rotates account cookies frequently on open YouTube browser tabs as a security measure. To export cookies that will remain working with yt-dlp, you will need to export cookies in such a way that they are never rotated.

One way to do this is through a private browsing/incognito window:

- Open a new private browsing/incognito window and log into YouTube
- Open a new tab and close the YouTube tab
- Export youtube.com cookies from the browser then close the private browsing/incognito window so the session is never opened in the browser again.

For export you can use browser extension [Cookie-Editor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm)

create in project folder subfolder `TXT` and place `cookie.txt` extracted from YouTube here

```sh
cd tg-ytdlp-bot/TXT
nano cookie.txt
```

#### Advanced YouTube Cookie Management

The bot now supports automatic downloading and validation of YouTube cookies from multiple sources:

**Features:**
- **Multiple Sources**: Configure up to 10 different cookie sources
- **Automatic Validation**: Each downloaded cookie is tested for functionality
- **Fallback System**: If one source fails, automatically tries the next
- **Real-time Progress**: Shows download and validation progress to users

**Configuration in `CONFIG/config.py`:**
```python
# YouTube cookies URLs - main URL and backups
# The bot will check cookies in the order: YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL, YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_1, YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_2, etc.
# If one URL does not work or the cookies are expired, the bot will automatically try the next one
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie1.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_1 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie2.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_2 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie3.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_3 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie4.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_4 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie5.txt"
# Add more sources as needed (up to YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_9)
```

**How it works:**
1. User runs `/download_cookie` and selects YouTube
2. Bot downloads cookies from the first available source
3. Validates cookies by testing them with a YouTube video
4. If validation fails, automatically tries the next source
5. Continues until working cookies are found or all sources are exhausted

**User Experience:**
- Progress updates: "üîÑ Downloading and checking YouTube cookies... Attempt 1 of 4"
- Success message: "‚úÖ YouTube cookies successfully downloaded and validated! Used source 2 of 4"
- Failure message: "‚ùå All YouTube cookies are expired or unavailable! Contact the bot administrator to replace them."

Also you may fill in `porn_domains.txt` `porn_keywords.txt` files in `TXT` folder if you want to tag #porn videos and hide them under spoiler

**Important Notes:**
- **Admin IDs**: Add your Telegram user ID to the `ADMIN` list to access admin commands
- **Channel IDs**: Both logging and subscription channels are required
- **Cookie URLs**: Must point to `.txt` files with Netscape cookie format
- **Firebase**: Required for caching and user data management
- **API Credentials**: Get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)

**Getting API Credentials:**
1. **Bot Token**: Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a new bot
2. **API ID & Hash**: Visit [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org), log in, and go to "API development tools"
3. **Channel IDs**: Add your bot to the channels and get the channel IDs (they start with -100)

**Getting Your User ID:**
- Message [@UserInfoToBot](https://t.me/UserInfoToBot) to get your Telegram user ID
- Add this ID to the `ADMIN` list in config.py

**Setting Up Firebase:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project
2. Enable Realtime Database and Authentication
3. Create a user with email/password authentication
4. Get your Firebase configuration from Project Settings
5. Update the `FIREBASE_CONF` section in config.py with your project details

**Cookie File Setup:**
1. Create cookie files in Netscape format for each service. You can use this browser extension https://cookie-editor.com/  
2. Upload them to a web server accessible via HTTPS. You can use your own Github repo for that.
3. Update the cookie URLs in config.py to point to your files. For Github repo ensure you use RAW URLs to your text cookie files.
4. Ensure files are under 100KB and accessible without authentication

**Setting Up Channels:**
1. **Logging Channel**: Create a private channel for bot logs
   - Add your bot as admin with "Send Messages" permission

Edit your configuration before deployment.

#### Install `python` modules

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing ffmpeg (example for Ubuntu/Debian)
      
   you also need to install `ffmpeg` https://github.com/btbn/ffmpeg-builds/releases
   **ffmpeg** is essential since **yt-dlp** relies on it for merging streams (and in some cases for transcoding or extracting thumbnails). Also ffmpeg is needed for embedding subtitles and for slpitting bigger that 2gb videos into parts. To install ffmpeg on a Debian-based system, run:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg
   ```

   Verify the installation:
   ```sh
   ffmpeg -version
   ```
---
### (Optional) Arabic and Asian fonts

<details>
   <summary>spoiler</summary> 
      
If you need to support extra languages such as arabic, chinese, japanese, korean - you also need to install this language packs:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo add-apt-repository universe
   sudo apt update

   sudo apt install fonts-noto-core             # ‚Äì Noto Sans, Noto Serif, ‚Ä¶ base fonts Google Noto
   sudo apt install fonts-noto-extra            # ‚Äì extra fonts (including arabic)
   sudo apt install fonts-kacst fonts-kacst-one # ‚Äì KACST arabic fonts
   sudo apt install fonts-noto-cjk              # ‚Äì Chinese-Japanese-Korean characters
   sudo apt install fonts-indic                 # ‚Äì extra indian fonts

   sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji fontconfig libass9
   ```

   For Amiri arabic:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aliftype/amiri.git
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/fonts/truetype/amiri
   sudo cp amiri/fonts/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/amiri/
   ```
   
   Update font cache
   ```sh
   sudo fc-cache -fv
   fc-list | grep -i amiri
   ``` 
</details>

---
### (Optional) Preparing `yt-dlp` for `/cookies_from_browser`
<details>
   <summary>spoiler</summary> 

   To use the `/cookies_from_browser` command (which extracts cookies from installed browsers on your server), ensure that the **yt-dlp** binary is set up properly:
  
   1. **Download `yt-dlp`**  
      Visit the [official `yt-dlp` releases page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) and download the binary for your CPU architecture (e.g., `yt-dlp_x86_64`, `yt-dlp_arm`, etc.).  
      Place the binary executable in the `tg-ytdlp-bot` project folder.
 
  2. **Rename and make it executable**  
     ```bash
     mv yt-dlp_linux yt-dlp
     chmod +x yt-dlp
     ```

   3. **Create a symbolic link**  
      Create a symlink so that `yt-dlp` can be run from any directory (for example, in `/usr/local/bin`):
      ```bash
      sudo ln -s /full/path/to/tg-ytdlp-bot/yt-dlp /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
      ```
      Ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH`. Now you can run `yt-dlp` directly.

   (Also in that case you must install desktop environment (GUI) and any supported by `yt-dlp` browser by yourself)

The bot features a comprehensive cookie management system that supports multiple services and automatic validation.

### YouTube Cookie Management

**Automatic Download and Validation:**
- **Multiple Sources**: Configure up to 10 different cookie sources in `config.py`
- **Sequential Testing**: Bot tests each source in order until working cookies are found
- **Real-time Validation**: Each downloaded cookie is tested with a YouTube video
- **Automatic Fallback**: If one source fails, automatically tries the next

**Configuration Example:**
```python
# In CONFIG/config.py
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie1.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_1 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie2.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_2 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie3.txt"
# ... up to YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_9
```

**User Commands:**
- `/download_cookie` ‚Üí YouTube: Downloads and validates cookies from multiple sources
- `/check_cookie`: Validates existing cookies and checks YouTube functionality
- `/cookies_from_browser`: Extracts cookies from installed browsers
- `/save_as_cookie`: Upload custom cookie file

**Cookie Validation Process:**
1. **Download**: Fetches cookie file from configured source
2. **Format Check**: Validates Netscape cookie format
3. **Size Validation**: Ensures file size is under 100KB
4. **YouTube Test**: Tests cookies with a short YouTube video
5. **Error Analysis**: Distinguishes between authentication and network errors
6. **Fallback**: Tries next source if current one fails

### Other Service Cookies

The bot also supports cookies for other platforms:
- **Instagram**: `INSTAGRAM_COOKIE_URL`
- **TikTok**: `TIKTOK_COOKIE_URL`
- **Facebook**: `FACEBOOK_COOKIE_URL`
- **Twitter**: `TWITTER_COOKIE_URL`

### Cookie File Requirements

**Format**: Must be in Netscape cookie format:
```
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
.youtube.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1735689600	VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE	abc123
.youtube.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1735689600	LOGIN_INFO	abc123
```

**Size Limit**: Maximum 100KB per cookie file

**Access**: Cookie files must be accessible via HTTP/HTTPS URLs

### Security Features

- **URL Hiding**: Source URLs are hidden from users in error messages

- **/reload_porn** - Reload porn detection cache (domains, keywords, supported sites) without restarting the bot.
---

## Auto cache ‚Äì how it works (on/off/N)

The bot maintains a local JSON cache (dump) of Firebase data. A background reloader can periodically refresh this cache by first downloading a fresh dump and then reloading it into memory.

- Refresh cycle:
  - Download dump via REST (`download_firebase.py` logic)
  - Reload local JSON into memory
- Interval alignment: next run is aligned to steps from midnight (00:00) with your interval step (N hours).
- Logging examples you will see:
  - `üîÑ Downloading and reloading Firebase cache dump...`
  - `‚úÖ Firebase cache refreshed successfully!`

### Command usage
- `/auto_cache on` ‚Äì enable background auto-refresh
- `/auto_cache off` ‚Äì disable background auto-refresh
- `/auto_cache N` ‚Äì set refresh interval to N hours (1..168)
  - This immediately updates runtime settings
  - The value is also persisted to `CONFIG/config.py` by updating `RELOAD_CACHE_EVERY = N`
  - The background thread is safely restarted so the new interval takes effect right away

Your current default interval comes from `CONFIG/config.py`:
```python
RELOAD_CACHE_EVERY = 24  # in hours
```

---

## Porn Detection Management

The bot includes advanced porn detection capabilities with configurable domain and keyword lists. Admins can manage these lists using dedicated commands.

### Porn Detection Commands

#### `/update_porn`
Runs an external script to update porn domains and keywords from external sources.

**Features:**
- Executes customizable script (default: `./script.sh`)
- Shows real-time script output and execution status
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Script path configurable via `CONFIG/domains.py`

**Configuration:**
```python
# In CONFIG/domains.py
UPDATE_PORN_SCRIPT_PATH = "./script.sh"  # Customize script path
```

#### `/reload_porn`
Reloads the porn detection cache without restarting the bot.

**Features:**
- Hot-reloads porn domains from `TXT/porn_domains.txt`
- Hot-reloads porn keywords from `TXT/porn_keywords.txt`
- Hot-reloads supported sites from `TXT/supported_sites.txt`
- Shows current cache statistics
- Immediate effect - no bot restart required

### File Structure
```
TXT/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ porn_domains.txt      # List of porn domains (one per line)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ porn_keywords.txt     # List of porn keywords (one per line)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ supported_sites.txt   # List of supported video sites

script.sh                 # Update script (customizable)
```

### Integration
These commands integrate with the existing porn detection system:
- **Domain Detection**: Checks video URLs against porn domain lists
- **Keyword Detection**: Scans video titles, descriptions, and captions
- **Auto-tagging**: Automatically adds `#porn` tag to detected content
- **Spoiler Protection**: Hides porn content under spoiler tags in Telegram

### Security
- Both commands are admin-only with proper access control
- Script execution is logged for audit purposes
- Script runs from the bot's root directory
- Script output is captured and displayed to the admin

---

## Updating the bot (updater scripts)

You can update only Python files from the `main` branch of `chelaxian/tg-ytdlp-bot` using provided scripts. The updater will:
- Clone the repository to a temporary directory
- Update only `*.py` files in your working directory
- Preserve your `CONFIG/config.py` and other excluded files/directories
- Make backups of changed files with suffix `.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMM` and move them into `_backup/` (original structure preserved)
- Ask for confirmation before applying changes

### One-command update (recommended)
```bash
./update.sh
```
- The script checks prerequisites and runs the Python updater.
- After a successful update, restart the bot service (if you use systemd):
```bash
systemctl restart tg-ytdlp-bot
journalctl -u tg-ytdlp-bot -f
```

### Manual update via Python
```bash
python3 update_from_repo.py --show-excluded   # show excluded files/folders
python3 update_from_repo.py                   # interactive update (prompts for confirmation)
```

---

## Restoring from backups

When the updater changes files, it creates backups and moves them into the `_backup/` folder, preserving the original directory structure. Backup filenames have a suffix `.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMM` (minute-level). The restore tool allows you to revert to a selected backup index.

### Interactive restore (recommended)
```bash
python3 restore_from_backup.py
```
- Use Arrow keys (or j/k) to navigate, PgUp/PgDn for paging, Enter to select, q to quit.
- The list shows grouped backups by minute: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] files: N (id: YYYYMMDD_HHMM)`.
- After confirmation, all files from that backup are restored to the project root, with the `.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMM` suffix stripped.

### List available backups
```bash
python3 restore_from_backup.py --list
```
Outputs available backup IDs (newest first) with file counts.

### Non-interactive restore by ID
```bash
python3 restore_from_backup.py --timestamp YYYYMMDD_HHMM
```
Restores all files for the specified backup ID.

### After restore
If you run the bot as a service, restart it:
```bash
systemctl restart tg-ytdlp-bot
journalctl -u tg-ytdlp-bot -f
```

## Link Command Pattern Spec

- **`https://example.com`** \
  Download the video with its original name. \
  If it is a playlist, only the first video is downloaded. 

- **`https://example.com*1*3`**  \
  Download a specified range of videos from the playlist with their original names. 

- **`https://example.com*1*3*name`**  \
  Download a specified range of videos from the playlist with a custom name. \
  Videos will be named as: 
  - `name - Part 1` 
  - `name - Part 2` 

---

## Tags System (Navigation Tags)

You can add tags to any link (video, playlist, audio) directly in your message:

- Format: `https://site.com/link#tag1#tag2#my_tag`
- Tags must start with `#` and contain only letters, digits, and underscore (`_`).
- Tags are automatically added to the caption of the video/audio, separated by spaces.
- All unique tags you send are saved in the `tags.txt` file in your user folder.

### Example of using tags:
```
https://youtu.be/STeeOaX2FBs?si=5rz1QhvuiauZ7A4d#youtube#mytag#tag123
```
The video caption will include:
```
#youtube #mytag #tag123
```

---

### /tags Command

The `/tags` command lets you get a list of all your unique tags (one per line). If the list is long, the bot will send several messages.

**Example:**
```
/tags
```
Response:
```
#youtube
#mytag
#tag123
...
```
---

## Auto-Cleaning User Directories with Crontab

To prevent your server from filling up with downloaded files, you can set up a crontab task that runs every 24 hours and deletes all files in user directories (except for `cookie.txt` and `logs.txt`).

For example, add the following line to your crontab:

```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/find /root/Telegram/tg-ytdlp-bot/users -type f ! -name "cookie.txt" ! -name "logs.txt" -delete
```

## Firebase Setup for Telegram Bot

This section describes how to create a Firebase project, set up the Realtime Database with authentication, create a test user, and integrate Firebase into your Telegram bot.

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click **Add Project** (or select an existing project).
2. Follow the setup wizard to create your new project.
3. After the project is created, navigate to **Project Settings** and copy your configuration parameters (such as `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `databaseURL`, `projectId`, etc.). These values are required for configuring the connection in your bot.

### 2. Create a Realtime Database

1. In the Firebase Console, select **Realtime Database**.
2. Click **Create Database**.
3. Choose your database location and set the mode. For initial testing, you may choose **Test Mode** (keep in mind that test mode does not enforce authentication).
4. Once your database is created, update its security rules as described in Step 4.

### 3. Enable Authentication

1. In the left-hand menu of the Firebase Console, select **Authentication**.
2. Click **Get Started**.
3. Navigate to the **Sign-in Method** tab and enable the desired provider. For a basic setup, enable **Email/Password**:
   - Click on **Email/Password**.
   - Toggle the switch to **Enable**.
4. After enabling the sign-in method, create a test user manually in the **Users** tab, or implement user registration in your application.

### 4. Update Realtime Database Security Rules

To restrict access to your database only to authenticated users, update your security rules as follows:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    // Allow access only to authenticated user with certain email
    ".read":  "auth != null && auth.token.email === 'YOUREMAIL@gmail.com'",
    ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.email === 'YOUREMAIL@gmail.com'"
  }
}
```

These rules allow read and write operations only if the request contains a valid `idToken`‚Äîmeaning the user is authenticated.

### 5. Autostart service

To create auto-start service for this bot - copy text from this file https://github.com/chelaxian/tg-ytdlp-bot/blob/main/etc/systemd/system/tg-ytdlp-bot.service and paste it to 
```bash
/etc/systemd/system/tg-ytdlp-bot.service
```
do not forget to change path in service to yoyr actual path

reload systemctl and enable/start service
```bash
systemctl daemon-reexec
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable tg-ytdlp-bot.service
systemctl restart tg-ytdlp-bot.service
journalctl -u tg-ytdlp-bot -f
```
