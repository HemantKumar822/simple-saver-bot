**Important Notes:**
- **Admin IDs**: Add your Telegram user ID to the `ADMIN` list to access admin commands
- **Channel IDs**: Both logging and subscription channels are required
- **Cookie URLs**: Must point to `.txt` files with Netscape cookie format
- **Firebase**: Required for caching and user data management
- **API Credentials**: Get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)

**Getting API Credentials:**
1. **Bot Token**: Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a new bot
2. **API ID & Hash**: Visit [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org), log in, and go to "API development tools"
3. **Channel IDs**: Add your bot to the channels and get the channel IDs (they start with -100)

**Getting Your User ID:**
- Message [@UserInfoToBot](https://t.me/UserInfoToBot) to get your Telegram user ID
- Add this ID to the `ADMIN` list in config.py

**Setting Up Firebase:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project
2. Enable Realtime Database and Authentication
3. Create a user with email/password authentication
4. Get your Firebase configuration from Project Settings
5. Update the `FIREBASE_CONF` section in config.py with your project details

**Cookie File Setup:**
1. Create cookie files in Netscape format for each service. You can use this browser extension https://cookie-editor.com/  
2. Upload them to a web server accessible via HTTPS. You can use your own Github repo for that.
3. Update the cookie URLs in config.py to point to your files. For Github repo ensure you use RAW URLs to your text cookie files.
4. Ensure files are under 100KB and accessible without authentication

**Setting Up Channels:**
1. **Logging Channel**: Create a private channel for bot logs
   - Add your bot as admin with "Send Messages" permission
   - Get the channel ID (starts with -100)
   - Update `LOGS_ID` in config.py

2. **Subscription Channel**: Create a public/private channel for user subscription
   - Add your bot as admin
   - Get the channel ID and invite link
   - Update `SUBSCRIBE_CHANNEL` and `SUBSCRIBE_CHANNEL_URL` in config.py

**Channel ID Format:**
- Public channels: `-100` + channel ID
- Private channels: `-100` + channel ID
- Example: If your channel ID is `1234567890`, use `-1001234567890`

**Getting Channel IDs:**
1. **Method 1**: Forward a message from your channel to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
2. **Method 2**: Use [@getidsbot](https://t.me/getidsbot) - send it a link to your channel
3. **Method 3**: Add [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to your channel and check the forwarded message

**Important**: Both channels are required for the bot to function properly.

Edit your configuration before deployment.

#### Install `python` modules

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```
---
### Installing ffmpeg (example for Ubuntu/Debian)
      
   you also need to install `ffmpeg` https://github.com/btbn/ffmpeg-builds/releases
   **ffmpeg** is essential since **yt-dlp** relies on it for merging streams (and in some cases for transcoding or extracting thumbnails). Also ffmpeg is needed for embedding subtitles and for slpitting bigger that 2gb videos into parts. To install ffmpeg on a Debian-based system, run:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg
   ```

   Verify the installation:
   ```sh
   ffmpeg -version
   ```
---
### (Optional) Arabic and Asian fonts

<details>
   <summary>spoiler</summary> 
      
If you need to support extra languages such as arabic, chinese, japanese, korean - you also need to install this language packs:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo add-apt-repository universe
   sudo apt update

   sudo apt install fonts-noto-core             # – Noto Sans, Noto Serif, … base fonts Google Noto
   sudo apt install fonts-noto-extra            # – extra fonts (including arabic)
   sudo apt install fonts-kacst fonts-kacst-one # – KACST arabic fonts
   sudo apt install fonts-noto-cjk              # – Chinese-Japanese-Korean characters
   sudo apt install fonts-indic                 # – extra indian fonts

   sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji fontconfig libass9
   ```

   For Amiri arabic:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aliftype/amiri.git
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/fonts/truetype/amiri
   sudo cp amiri/fonts/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/amiri/
   ```
   
   Update font cache
   ```sh
   sudo fc-cache -fv
   fc-list | grep -i amiri
   ``` 
</details>

---
### (Optional) Preparing `yt-dlp` for `/cookies_from_browser`
<details>
   <summary>spoiler</summary> 

   To use the `/cookies_from_browser` command (which extracts cookies from installed browsers on your server), ensure that the **yt-dlp** binary is set up properly:
  
   1. **Download `yt-dlp`**  
      Visit the [official `yt-dlp` releases page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) and download the binary for your CPU architecture (e.g., `yt-dlp_x86_64`, `yt-dlp_arm`, etc.).  
      Place the binary executable in the `tg-ytdlp-bot` project folder.
 
  2. **Rename and make it executable**  
     ```bash
     mv yt-dlp_linux yt-dlp
     chmod +x yt-dlp
     ```

   3. **Create a symbolic link**  
      Create a symlink so that `yt-dlp` can be run from any directory (for example, in `/usr/local/bin`):
      ```bash
      sudo ln -s /full/path/to/tg-ytdlp-bot/yt-dlp /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
      ```
      Ensure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH`. Now you can run `yt-dlp` directly.

   (Also in that case you must install desktop environment (GUI) and any supported by `yt-dlp` browser by yourself)

</details>

---

#### Get YouTube cookies

YouTube rotates account cookies frequently on open YouTube browser tabs as a security measure. To export cookies that will remain working with yt-dlp, you will need to export cookies in such a way that they are never rotated.

One way to do this is through a private browsing/incognito window:

- Open a new private browsing/incognito window and log into YouTube
- In same window and same tab from step 1, navigate to https://www.youtube.com/robots.txt (this should be the only private/incognito browsing tab open)
- Export youtube.com cookies from the browser, then close the private browsing/incognito window so that the session is never opened in the browser again.

For export you can use browser extension [Cookie-Editor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm)

create in project folder subfolder `TXT` and place `cookie.txt` extracted from YouTube here

```sh
cd tg-ytdlp-bot/TXT
nano cookie.txt
```

#### Advanced YouTube Cookie Management

The bot now supports automatic downloading and validation of YouTube cookies from multiple sources:

**Features:**
- **Multiple Sources**: Configure up to 10 different cookie sources
- **Automatic Validation**: Each downloaded cookie is tested for functionality
- **Fallback System**: If one source fails, automatically tries the next
- **Real-time Progress**: Shows download and validation progress to users

**Configuration in `CONFIG/config.py`:**
```python
# YouTube cookies URLs - main URL and backups
# The bot will check cookies in the order: YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL, YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_1, YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_2, etc.
# If one URL does not work or the cookies are expired, the bot will automatically try the next one
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie1.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_1 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie2.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_2 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie3.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_3 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie4.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_4 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie5.txt"
# Add more sources as needed (up to YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_9)
```

**How it works:**
1. User runs `/cookie` and selects YouTube
2. Bot downloads cookies from the first available source
3. Validates cookies by testing them with a YouTube video
4. If validation fails, automatically tries the next source
5. Continues until working cookies are found or all sources are exhausted

**User Experience:**
- Progress updates: "🔄 Downloading and checking YouTube cookies... Attempt 1 of 4"
- Success message: "✅ YouTube cookies successfully downloaded and validated! Used source 2 of 4"
- Failure message: "❌ All YouTube cookies are expired or unavailable! Contact the bot administrator to replace them."

Also you may fill in `porn_domains.txt` `porn_keywords.txt` files in `TXT` folder if you want to tag #nsfw videos and hide them under spoiler

## PO Token Provider Setup (YouTube Bypass)

The bot now supports **PO Token Provider** for bypassing YouTube's "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" restrictions and other blocking mechanisms.

### What is PO Token Provider?

PO (Proof-of-Origin) Token Provider is a service that generates tokens to make your yt-dlp requests appear more legitimate to YouTube, helping bypass various blocking mechanisms including:
- "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" messages
- IP-based restrictions
- Rate limiting
- Other anti-bot measures

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

#### 1. Install Docker (if not already installed)

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

#### 2. Run PO Token Provider Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name bgutil-provider \
  -p 4416:4416 \
  --init \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider
```

**Parameters:**
- `-d`: Run in background (detached mode)
- `--name bgutil-provider`: Container name
- `-p 4416:4416`: Map port 4416 (container) to 4416 (host)
- `--init`: Proper process handling
- `--restart unless-stopped`: Auto-restart on reboot or crash

#### 3. Verify Installation

Check if container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

Test the provider:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4416
```

#### 4. Install yt-dlp Plugin

Install the PO token provider plugin for yt-dlp:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -U bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider
```

#### 5. Configure Bot

The bot is already configured to use PO token provider. Settings in `CONFIG/config.py`:

```python
# PO Token Provider configuration for YouTube
YOUTUBE_POT_ENABLED = True
YOUTUBE_POT_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:4416"
YOUTUBE_POT_DISABLE_INNERTUBE = False
```

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: Bot automatically detects YouTube URLs
2. **Token Generation**: PO token provider generates legitimate tokens
3. **Request Enhancement**: yt-dlp uses these tokens to bypass restrictions
4. **Transparent Operation**: Works seamlessly with existing proxy and cookie systems

### Benefits

- ✅ Bypasses "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" messages
- ✅ Reduces IP-based blocking
- ✅ Improves download success rates
- ✅ Works with existing proxy and cookie configurations
- ✅ Automatic integration - no user action required

## Advanced Features

### PO Token Provider (YouTube Bypass)

The bot automatically uses PO Token Provider for all YouTube operations to bypass various restrictions:

**Features:**
- **Automatic Detection**: Works transparently with all YouTube URLs
- **Restriction Bypass**: Handles "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" messages
- **IP Protection**: Reduces IP-based blocking and rate limiting
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing proxy and cookie systems
- **No User Action**: Completely automatic - no commands needed

**How it works:**
1. Bot detects YouTube URLs automatically
2. PO token provider generates legitimate tokens
3. yt-dlp uses these tokens to bypass restrictions
4. Downloads proceed normally with enhanced success rates

**Configuration:**
```python
# In CONFIG/config.py
YOUTUBE_POT_ENABLED = True
YOUTUBE_POT_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:4416"
YOUTUBE_POT_DISABLE_INNERTUBE = False
```

**Technical Details:**
- Uses proper Python API format for `extractor_args`: `dict -> dict -> list[str]`
- `disable_innertube` is only added when enabled (as `["1"]` string in list)
- Compatible with yt-dlp >= 2025.05.22
- Works with both HTTP and script-based providers
- **Automatic Fallback**: If PO token provider is unavailable, bot automatically falls back to standard YouTube extraction
- **Health Monitoring**: Provider availability is cached and checked every 30 seconds

**Requirements:**
- Docker container running `brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider`
- yt-dlp plugin: `bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider`

**Fallback Mechanism:**
- **Automatic Detection**: Bot checks provider availability before each YouTube request
- **Cached Health Checks**: Provider status is cached for 30 seconds to avoid excessive requests
- **Graceful Degradation**: If provider is unavailable, bot automatically falls back to standard YouTube extraction
- **No User Impact**: Fallback is completely transparent to users
- **Admin Monitoring**: Provider health is automatically monitored and logged

### Proxy Download Support (`/proxy`)
- **Global Proxy Control**: Enable/disable proxy for all yt-dlp operations
- **User-Specific Settings**: Each user can independently control their proxy usage
- **Automatic Integration**: When enabled, proxy is automatically applied to all downloads
- **Cookie Support**: Works with user's cookie settings for private content
- **Persistent Settings**: Proxy preference is saved per-user in `proxy.txt` file

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
/proxy on                    # Enable proxy for all downloads
/proxy off                   # Disable proxy for all downloads
/proxy                      # Show proxy control menu
```

**How it works:**
1. User runs `/proxy on` to enable proxy
2. Bot saves preference to `users/{user_id}/proxy.txt`
3. All subsequent yt-dlp operations automatically use the configured proxy
4. User can disable with `/proxy off` at any time

### Enhanced Direct Link Extraction (`/link`)
- **Quality Selection**: Specify desired quality (e.g., `720`, `1080`, `4k`, `8k`)
- **Flexible Format**: Support for both numeric (`720`) and descriptive (`720p`, `4k`, `8K`) quality specifications
- **Smart Fallback**: Automatically falls back to best available quality if specified quality is not available
- **Dual Stream Support**: Returns both video and audio stream URLs when available
- **Proxy Support**: Works with configured proxy settings for restricted domains
- **Cookie Integration**: Uses user's cookie settings for private content access
- **Player Integration**: 🔗Link button in Always Ask menu now provides direct links for media players (VLC, MX Player, Infuse, IINA, nPlayer, MPV)

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
/link https://youtube.com/watch?v=...          # Best quality
/link 720 https://youtube.com/watch?v=...     # 720p or lower

- **Quick Arguments**: Set layout directly with arguments (e.g., `/keyboard off`, `/keyboard full`)

**Keyboard Modes:**
- **OFF**: Completely hides the reply keyboard
- **1x3**: Shows single row with `/clean`, `/cookie`, `/settings`
- **2x3**: Shows two rows with full command set (default mode)
- **FULL**: Shows emoji keyboard with visual command representation

### Improved Error Handling

## Cookie Management System

The bot features a comprehensive cookie management system that supports multiple services and automatic validation.

### YouTube Cookie Management

**Automatic Download and Validation:**
- **Multiple Sources**: Configure up to 10 different cookie sources in `config.py`
- **Sequential Testing**: Bot tests each source in order until working cookies are found
- **Real-time Validation**: Each downloaded cookie is tested with a YouTube video
- **Automatic Fallback**: If one source fails, automatically tries the next

**Configuration Example:**
```python
# In CONFIG/config.py
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie1.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_1 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie2.txt"
YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_2 = "https://your-domain.com/cookies/youtube/cookie3.txt"
# ... up to YOUTUBE_COOKIE_URL_9
```

**User Commands:**
- `/cookie` → YouTube: Downloads and validates cookies from multiple sources
- `/check_cookie`: Validates existing cookies and checks YouTube functionality
- `/cookies_from_browser`: Extracts cookies from installed browsers
- `/save_as_cookie`: Upload custom cookie file

**Cookie Validation Process:**
1. **Download**: Fetches cookie file from configured source
2. **Format Check**: Validates Netscape cookie format
3. **Size Validation**: Ensures file size is under 100KB
4. **YouTube Test**: Tests cookies with a short YouTube video
5. **Error Analysis**: Distinguishes between authentication and network errors
6. **Fallback**: Tries next source if current one fails

### Other Service Cookies

The bot also supports cookies for other platforms:
- **TikTok**: `TIKTOK_COOKIE_URL`
- **Twitter**: `TWITTER_COOKIE_URL`

### Cookie File Requirements

**Format**: Must be in Netscape cookie format:
```
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
.youtube.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1735689600	VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE	abc123
.youtube.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	1735689600	LOGIN_INFO	abc123
```

**Size Limit**: Maximum 100KB per cookie file

**Access**: Cookie files must be accessible via HTTP/HTTPS URLs

### Security Features

- **URL Hiding**: Source URLs are hidden from users in error messages
- **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive information is removed from logs
- **Temporary Files**: Cookie files are cleaned up after validation
- **Access Control**: Cookie management commands are properly restricted

---

## Auto cache – how it works (on/off/N)

The bot maintains a local JSON cache (dump) of Firebase data. A background reloader can periodically refresh this cache by first downloading a fresh dump and then reloading it into memory.

- Refresh cycle:
  - Download dump via REST (`download_firebase.py` logic)
  - Reload local JSON into memory
- Interval alignment: next run is aligned to steps from midnight (00:00) with your interval step (N hours).
- Logging examples you will see:
  - `🔄 Downloading and reloading Firebase cache dump...`
  - `✅ Firebase cache refreshed successfully!`

### Command usage
- `/auto_cache on` – enable background auto-refresh
- `/auto_cache off` – disable background auto-refresh
- `/auto_cache N` – set refresh interval to N hours (1..168)
  - This immediately updates runtime settings
  - The value is also persisted to `CONFIG/config.py` by updating `RELOAD_CACHE_EVERY = N`
  - The background thread is safely restarted so the new interval takes effect right away

Your current default interval comes from `CONFIG/config.py`:
```python
RELOAD_CACHE_EVERY = 24  # in hours
```

---

## Porn Detection Management

The bot includes advanced porn detection capabilities with configurable domain and keyword lists. Admins can manage these lists using dedicated commands.

### Porn Detection Commands

#### `/update_porn`
Runs an external script to update porn domains and keywords from external sources.

**Features:**
- Executes customizable script (default: `./script.sh`)
- Shows real-time script output and execution status
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Script path configurable via `CONFIG/domains.py`

**Configuration:**
```python
# In CONFIG/domains.py
UPDATE_PORN_SCRIPT_PATH = "./script.sh"  # Customize script path
```

#### `/reload_porn`
Reloads the porn detection cache without restarting the bot.

**Features:**
- Hot-reloads porn domains from `TXT/porn_domains.txt`
- Hot-reloads porn keywords from `TXT/porn_keywords.txt`
- Hot-reloads supported sites from `TXT/supported_sites.txt`
- Shows current cache statistics
- Immediate effect - no bot restart required

### File Structure
```
TXT/
├── porn_domains.txt      # List of porn domains (one per line)
├── porn_keywords.txt     # List of porn keywords (one per line)
└── supported_sites.txt   # List of supported video sites

script.sh                 # Update script (customizable)
```

### Domain Filtering System
The bot uses a three-tier domain filtering system:

1. **WHITELIST** (`CONFIG/domains.py`): Domains completely excluded from porn detection
   - These domains and their subdomains are never checked for porn content
   - Example: `youtube.com`, `bilibili.com`, `dailymotion.com`

2. **GREYLIST** (`CONFIG/domains.py`): Domains excluded only from domain list check
   - These domains are still checked for porn keywords in titles/descriptions
   - But they are excluded from the `porn_domains.txt` file check
   - Useful for sites that might have adult content but aren't primarily porn sites

3. **BLACKLIST** (`CONFIG/domains.py`): Domains explicitly blocked
   - Currently empty by default, can be used to block specific domains

**Configuration in `CONFIG/domains.py`:**
```python
# Whitelist - completely excluded from porn detection
WHITELIST = [
    'bilibili.com', 'dailymotion.com', 'youtube.com', 'youtu.be',
    'twitch.tv', 'vimeo.com', 'facebook.com', 'tiktok.com'
]

# Greylist - excluded from domain list but still checked for keywords
GREYLIST = [
    'example.com', 'test.com'
    # Add domains here that should be excluded from porn_domains.txt check
    # but still checked against porn_keywords.txt
]
```

### Integration
These commands integrate with the existing porn detection system:
- **Domain Detection**: Checks video URLs against porn domain lists
- **Keyword Detection**: Scans video titles, descriptions, and captions
- **Auto-tagging**: Automatically adds `#nsfw` tag to detected content
- **Spoiler Protection**: Hides porn content under spoiler tags in Telegram

### Security
- Both commands are admin-only with proper access control
- Script execution is logged for audit purposes
- Script runs from the bot's root directory
- Script output is captured and displayed to the admin

---

## Updating the bot (updater scripts)

You can update only Python files from the `main` branch of `chelaxian/tg-ytdlp-bot` using provided scripts. The updater will:
- Clone the repository to a temporary directory
- Update only `*.py` files in your working directory
- Preserve your `CONFIG/config.py` and other excluded files/directories
- Make backups of changed files with suffix `.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMM` and move them into `_backup/` (original structure preserved)
- Ask for confirmation before applying changes

### One-command update (recommended)
```bash
./update.sh
```
- The script checks prerequisites and runs the Python updater.
- After a successful update, restart the bot service (if you use systemd):
```bash
systemctl restart tg-ytdlp-bot
journalctl -u tg-ytdlp-bot -f
```

### Manual update via Python
```bash
python3 update_from_repo.py --show-excluded   # show excluded files/folders
python3 update_from_repo.py                   # interactive update (prompts for confirmation)
```

---

## Restoring from backups

When the updater changes files, it creates backups and moves them into the `_backup/` folder, preserving the original directory structure. Backup filenames have a suffix `.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMM` (minute-level). The restore tool allows you to revert to a selected backup index.

### Interactive restore (recommended)
```bash
python3 restore_from_backup.py
```
- Use Arrow keys (or j/k) to navigate, PgUp/PgDn for paging, Enter to select, q to quit.
- The list shows grouped backups by minute: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] files: N (id: YYYYMMDD_HHMM)`.
- After confirmation, all files from that backup are restored to the project root, with the `.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMM` suffix stripped.

### List available backups
```bash
python3 restore_from_backup.py --list
```
Outputs available backup IDs (newest first) with file counts.

### Non-interactive restore by ID
```bash
python3 restore_from_backup.py --timestamp YYYYMMDD_HHMM
```
Restores all files for the specified backup ID.

### After restore
If you run the bot as a service, restart it:
```bash
systemctl restart tg-ytdlp-bot
journalctl -u tg-ytdlp-bot -f
```

## Link Command Pattern Spec

- **`https://example.com`** \
  Download the video with its original name. \
  If it is a playlist, only the first video is downloaded. 

- **`https://example.com*1*3`**  \
  Download a specified range of videos from the playlist with their original names. 

- **`https://example.com*1*3*name`**  \
  Download a specified range of videos from the playlist with a custom name. \
  Videos will be named as: 
  - `name - Part 1` 
  - `name - Part 2` 

---

## Tags System (Navigation Tags)

You can add tags to any link (video, playlist, audio) directly in your message:

- Format: `https://site.com/link#tag1#tag2#my_tag`
- Tags must start with `#` and contain only letters, digits, and underscore (`_`).
- Tags are automatically added to the caption of the video/audio, separated by spaces.
- All unique tags you send are saved in the `tags.txt` file in your user folder.

### Example of using tags:
```
https://youtu.be/STeeOaX2FBs?si=5rz1QhvuiauZ7A4d#youtube#mytag#tag123
```
The video caption will include:
```
#youtube #mytag #tag123
```

---

### /tags Command

The `/tags` command lets you get a list of all your unique tags (one per line). If the list is long, the bot will send several messages.

**Example:**
```
/tags
```
Response:
```
#youtube
#mytag
#tag123
...
```
---

## Auto-Cleaning User Directories with Crontab

To prevent your server from filling up with downloaded files, you can set up a crontab task that runs every 24 hours and deletes all files in user directories (except for `cookie.txt` and `logs.txt`).

For example, add the following line to your crontab:

```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/find /root/Telegram/tg-ytdlp-bot/users -type f ! -name "cookie.txt" ! -name "logs.txt" -delete
```

**Explanation:**
- `0 0 * * *` – Executes the command every day at midnight.
- `/usr/bin/find /CHANGE/ME/TO/REAL/PATH/TO/tg-ytdlp-bot/users -type f` – Searches for all files under the users directory.
- `! -name "cookie.txt" ! -name "logs.txt"` – Excludes `cookie.txt` and `logs.txt` files from deletion.
- `-delete` – Deletes the files found.

## Firebase Setup for Telegram Bot

This section describes how to create a Firebase project, set up the Realtime Database with authentication, create a test user, and integrate Firebase into your Telegram bot.

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click **Add Project** (or select an existing project).
2. Follow the setup wizard to create your new project.
3. After the project is created, navigate to **Project Settings** and copy your configuration parameters (such as `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `databaseURL`, `projectId`, etc.). These values are required for configuring the connection in your bot.

### 2. Create a Realtime Database

1. In the Firebase Console, select **Realtime Database**.
2. Click **Create Database**.
3. Choose your database location and set the mode. For initial testing, you may choose **Test Mode** (keep in mind that test mode does not enforce authentication).
4. Once your database is created, update its security rules as described in Step 4.

### 3. Enable Authentication

1. In the left-hand menu of the Firebase Console, select **Authentication**.
2. Click **Get Started**.
3. Navigate to the **Sign-in Method** tab and enable the desired provider. For a basic setup, enable **Email/Password**:
   - Click on **Email/Password**.
   - Toggle the switch to **Enable**.
4. After enabling the sign-in method, create a test user manually in the **Users** tab, or implement user registration in your application.

### 4. Update Realtime Database Security Rules

To restrict access to your database only to authenticated users, update your security rules as follows:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    // Allow access only to authenticated user with certain email
    ".read":  "auth != null && auth.token.email === 'YOUREMAIL@gmail.com'",
    ".write": "auth != null && auth.token.email === 'YOUREMAIL@gmail.com'"
  }
}
```

These rules allow read and write operations only if the request contains a valid `idToken`—meaning the user is authenticated.

### 5. Autostart service

To create auto-start service for this bot - copy text from this file https://github.com/chelaxian/tg-ytdlp-bot/blob/main/etc/systemd/system/tg-ytdlp-bot.service and paste it to 
```bash
/etc/systemd/system/tg-ytdlp-bot.service
```
do not forget to change path in service to yoyr actual path

reload systemctl and enable/start service
```bash
systemctl daemon-reexec
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable tg-ytdlp-bot.service
systemctl restart tg-ytdlp-bot.service
journalctl -u tg-ytdlp-bot -f
```

### Image Download Support (`/img`)

The bot now supports downloading images from various platforms using gallery-dl:

**Features:**
- **Multiple Platforms**: Supports direct image URLs and popular image hosting services
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects image URLs and formats
- **Proxy Support**: Works with configured proxy settings for restricted domains
- **Cookie Integration**: Uses user's cookie settings for private content access
- **Format Support**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, SVG and more

**Supported Platforms:**
- **Direct URLs**: Any direct image link with common extensions
- **Image Hosting**: Imgur, Flickr, DeviantArt, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter/X, Reddit
- **Cloud Storage**: Google Drive, Dropbox, Mega.nz
- **And many more** via gallery-dl's extensive extractor support

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
/img https://example.com/image.jpg          # Direct image URL
/img https://imgur.com/abc123              # Imgur link
/img https://flickr.com/photos/user/123456 # Flickr photo
/img https://instagram.com/p/abc123        # Instagram post
# Ranges (albums/feeds supported):
/img 11-20 https://example.com/album       # Download items 11..20
/img 11- https://example.com/album         # Download from item 11 up to limit
```

Notes:
- You can specify a numeric range as N-M (inclusive) or N- (from N to the end or until bot limit).
- If no range is provided, the bot autodetects total count and downloads up to the configured limit.

**How it works:**
1. User runs `/img URL` to download an image
2. Bot analyzes the URL using gallery-dl
3. Downloads the image to user's directory
4. Sends the image back to the user
5. Cleans up temporary files automatically

## Inline search helper (/search)

Use this command to quickly activate inline search via `@vid`.

- 📱 Mobile: tap the button shown by `/search`. It opens your chat with prefilled `@vid` and a zero‑width space. Add your query after `@vid`.
- 💻 PC/Desktop: inline deep-linking cannot prefill reliably. Type manually in any chat:
  - `@vid Your_Search_Query`

Notes:
- Desktop Telegram does not always send `/start` payloads from links repeatedly; avoid relying on `https://t.me/<bot>?start=...` for inline prefill.
- The bot's `/search` shows only working options and a concise manual hint.
